## 1.1. Restrict Document Implementation
Implement [Restrict Un Allowed User From Document](./README.md#restrict_un_allowed_user_from_document_topic)
- Set Document.allowedUsers to be a list with 1 user id
- Logging in as the a user different from the one in the list should lead to a 'user not allowed in document' pop-up
- Logging in as the allowed user should let the user participate in the document discussion (browse, vote)
## 1.2. Hide Voting Events Implementation
Implement [Voting Events Can Be Hidden From Activity Page](./README.md#voting_events_can_be_hidden_from_activity_page_topic)
